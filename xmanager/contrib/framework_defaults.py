"""Automatic selection of reasonable defaults based on input.

This library aimed to provide recommended defaults for the choices that can be
automated depending on the input. In particular, the choice of a base image
depends on a framework and accelerator used for the experiment, and can change
if a different accelerator is used. This module provides function
`base_image`, which returns the recommended base image to use without the need
to change the launcher's code.

Please note that the recommendations are subject to change as we are trying to
use the latest supported images for all frameworks. If a change in the
recommendation breaks your code, try to replace this call with the explicit
base image name.
